# Hi, Chogerlate here :)

## Brief Introduction
This repository contains a bunch of implementations of the papers that I found interesting. So I can come and look up the things that I might forget about while also sharing them with others who are also interested in them.Â 

Most of the things I've written here are simple notes and code implementation. I'm writing about this repository in some kind of blog post. So be prepared.

## Contents

- Algorithm reproductions
- Model architectures
- Experimental results

## Structure

- Each paper has its own directory
- README for each implementation with:
  - Paper title, authors, publication details
  - Key concepts
  - Implementation notes
  - Usage instructions

## Purpose

- Deepen understanding of cutting-edge research
- Provide reference implementations
- Facilitate reproducibility


## warning! I am professional yapper! 
My grammar skill is quite lacking, but I will try to improve them as we go through more paper.
and you can also check out the list of papers I wrote in the next section below.
