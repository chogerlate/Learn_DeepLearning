# Hi, Chogerlate here :)

## Brief Introduction
This repository contains a bunch of implementations of the papers that I found interesting. So I can come and look up the things that I might forget about while also sharing them with others who are also interested in them.Â 

Most of the things I've written here are simple notes and the code implementation. I'm writing about this repository in some kind of blog post. So be prepared.

warning! My grammar skill is quite poor, but I will try to improve it as we go through more paper.
and you can also check out the list of papers I wrote in the next section below.
